#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report


---

### Reflection

###1. Pipeline: The goal for this project was to generate the program necesary for detect the lines in a serie of images, inside of the video solidWhiteRight.mp4 and as well inside of the video solidYellowLeft.mp4, first of all was need it to detect the lines in the images (a video is a serie of images) through an analisys of every image and the after draw inside of the image the highligh of the lane lines

###2. Identify potential shortcomings:


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the dayligth change, I think can not be inteligent enough to keep detecting the lane lines


###3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

Improve the code for drawing lines, I think the draw could work better if the draw will be outside of the second for sentence
